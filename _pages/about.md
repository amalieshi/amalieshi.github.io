I am a biomedical engineer who specializes in computational medicine, experimental modeling, data science, CAD modeling, and process design and improvement. I received my Master of Science in Engineering in biomedical engineering from Johns Hopkins University and my Bachelor of Science in biomedical engineering from Georgia Tech. I currently serve as a software application engineer at Informetric involving in software testing and development. I previously served as a pharmaceutical engineer validating and verifying equipment and process design. During my Master's thesis, I developed a manufacturing and quantitative assessment pipeline to produce anthropomorphic phantoms that mimick features such as the trabecular bone textures, the vascular stenosis structures, and blood vessels when injected with contrast agents.

Previous projects include the implantable device design improvement, kinesiology study of peripheral nerve injury on feline models, myocarditis effects on immune cell clustering in the cardiac tissues, and data analysis of a wearable ubiquitous sensing system that tracks the adherence of medication regimen.
