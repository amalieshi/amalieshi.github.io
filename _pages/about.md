I am a biomedical engineer who specializes in diagnostic medical imaging. I am passionate about medicine. I received my Master of Science in Engineering in biomedical engineering from Johns Hopkins University and my Bachelor of Science in biomedical engineering from Georgia Tech. I currently serve as a software test engineer at Adaptix in software testing and development. I previously served as a software engineer at a pharmaceutical electronic batch record company and a pharmaceutical engineer validating and verifying equipment and process design. During my Master's thesis, I developed a manufacturing and quantitative assessment pipeline to produce anthropomorphic phantoms that mimick features such as the trabecular bone textures, the vascular stenosis structures, and blood vessels when injected with contrast agents.

My previous research projects include an animal study on the implantable device design improvement, some kinesiology study of peripheral nerve injury on feline models, the myocarditis effects on immune cell clustering in the cardiac tissues, and some data analysis of a wearable ubiquitous sensing system that tracks the adherence of medication regimen.
