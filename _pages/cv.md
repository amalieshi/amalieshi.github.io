## Conference Presentations

<li>
  <strong>Automate the UI Software Using Python</strong>  
  <br>
  <em>Conference Presentation</em>  
  <p>
  Verifying performance and safety is critical, but has been a bottleneck in the medical software release process. UI software testing, being the most complex and integrated component, has traditionally been tested manually. Because the UI software is constantly updated, building automated UI testing solutions (TAS) for continuous verification offers significant benefits — reducing manual labor and human errors, enabling early detection of software issues, and strengthening the robustness of the development lifecycle.
  </p>
  <p>
  This presentation introduces a **readable and maintainable Python-based automation framework** for medical imaging applications that emulates user interactions, communicates with external web APIs, performs data validation, records test evidence, and generates comprehensive test reports.
