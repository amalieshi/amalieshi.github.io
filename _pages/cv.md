* September 2017 - December 2017: Research Assistant
  * Laboratory of Computational Motor Control at Johns Hopkins University
  * Duties included:
	   * Designed experiments using robotic manipulandum to test the hypothesis whether the holding and moving neural circuits of the wrist are separate through force adaptation and error clamp trials

* September 2013 - July 2017: Research Assistant
  * Neurophysiology Lab at Georgia Institute of Technology
  * Duties included:
	   * Initiate an exploratory experimentation in developing an engineered feedback controlled stimulation system to ameliorate foot drop system by electrically stimulating the muscle through intramuscular electrodes.
	   * Simulate the stretch of a muscle to predict the response of another muscle with the known muscular force feedback with NEUROMECHANIC   
	   * Participated in the feline survival surgery (FHL muscle nerve reinnervation surgery)	   
	   * Collected the neurobehavioral data of cats running up and down a ramp or stairs and analyzed the kinematic behavior of the cat with/without the survival surgery using various programs (LabVIEW, Vicon, MATLAB)
  * Supervisor: Professor T Richard Nichols, Ph.D.
