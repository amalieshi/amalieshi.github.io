### [Automate the UI Software Using Python](https://zenodo.org/records/15118990)

**Amalie Shi**

Verifying performance and safety is critical but has long been a bottleneck in the medical software release process. UI software testing—being the most integrated and complex component—has traditionally been performed manually.

This project presents a **unique, readable, and maintainable test automation method** applied in medical imaging using **Python**. It leverages Python libraries to emulate user interactions with the UI, communicate with external web APIs, validate test data, record test evidence, and generate automated test reports.

The automation solution enhances **testing efficiency**, ensures **consistency in regression testing**, reduces **human error**, and strengthens the **software development lifecycle**.
